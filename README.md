# Sourcemod Mapchooser Extended

This repository is a fork of a fork of a fork ᵒᶠ ᵃ ᶠᵒʳᵏ...

The goal of this fork is to gather some of the changes and bugfixes that have been made to this plugin, but have been
spread out among the many forks there are, and sometimes baked into other features. For example Sneaks-Community has
added support for Tiers from various plugins, which I do not need, but otherwise has some nice fixes.

In the future, here might be a list of fixes compared to the original version uploaded to GitHub by powerlord.

## Changes
