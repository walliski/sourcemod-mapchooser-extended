# Sourcemod Mapchooser Extended

> **Note:** This was a project that I started to clean up and make a "proper" version of this plugin, since many asked about it.
> It got left behind a bit, and is currently untested and not actively developed. Your miles may vary when using
> this version. Make sure to also check out Sneak's community's fork, linked below in the Credits section.

This repository is a fork of a fork of a fork ᵒᶠ ᵃ ᶠᵒʳᵏ...

The goal of this fork is to gather some of the changes and bugfixes that have been made to this plugin, but have been
spread out among the many forks there are, and sometimes baked into other features. For example Sneaks-Community has
added support for Tiers from various plugins, which I do not need, but otherwise has some nice fixes.
